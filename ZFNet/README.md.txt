CAM - CLASS ACTIVATION MAPPING
The key idea of this research paper it to understand what the
model learns in the middle layers since the model interpretability
is very low and if the model fails, we have no clue why.

The central architecture is to use specific convolutional
neural network and produce heat maps.

The architecture 
* Convolutional layers
* Global Average Pooling
* The last fully connected layer to predict the classes
